- Updates sensor status from existing live events without rebuilding checkboxes or adding polling. Keeps 0.5.3 as the homeowner-approved stable rollback.

## 0.5.8

- Gives Lighting natural-height, tightly packed responsive room cards instead of stretching every room to the tallest neighbor. Layout updates are local and batched, including when opening brightness controls or resizing; no additional API polling.
- Orders Lighting areas as common areas, closets, outside, bedrooms, then bathrooms, alphabetically within each category with numeric sorting. Recognizes the existing Bedoom spelling without renaming rooms.
- Removes the Room Modes saved/enabled footer and routine Save button. Checkbox changes still save automatically, with accessible progress and an error-only Retry control that preserves the unsaved selections.
- Keeps existing light controls, alarm assignments, and stable rollback 0.5.3 unchanged.

## 0.5.7

- Moves Armed Away, Armed Stay Kids, Armed Stay Adult, and Disarmed selections out of Room Modes into Settings → Alarm, with four dark-glass, blue-accent cards and automatically saved room assignments.
- Keeps existing selections, helpers, scene configurations, and alarm automations. Page-scoped saves preserve the other page's settings under the settings lock; configuration does not arm/disarm the house.
- Keeps 0.5.3 as the homeowner-approved stable rollback.

## 0.5.6

- Matches Settings → Room Modes cards to House Mode's dark glass background, blue border and left accent, with subtle blue selected options and white labels. No mode behavior or automation changes.
- Keeps 0.5.3 as the homeowner-approved stable rollback.

## 0.5.5

- Removes presence, door/window, temperature, humidity, and lux rows from Lighting room headers. Lighting transfers only light groups and no longer refreshes on sensor-only events; Security and the Exterior toolbar remain live.
- Moves room-mode checklists from Home Configurator into Settings → Room Modes, with automatic saving and the existing bedroom-specific choices. Existing settings and specialized bedroom automations remain intact.
- Adds Scenes → Room Scenes. Every enabled room/mode gets its own configuration card, with light/group selection, 0–100% brightness, and color/tone controls. Saved scenes run when their room enters that mode, not while configuring it.
- Disabling a mode removes its scene automation while retaining the scene settings for reuse. Room-mode helpers stay available to existing controls, even when no modes are selected.
- Uses the compact room index and shared action catalog for the new screens. Saving modes invalidates dependent scene/editor caches without adding startup-blocking inventory requests.
- Keeps 0.5.3 as the homeowner-approved stable rollback. This is a candidate until explicitly approved.

## 0.5.4

- Keeps 0.5.3 as the homeowner-approved stable rollback release; this update remains a candidate until accepted.
- Maintains the live inventory by entity ID, replacing only the changed record instead of rebuilding and sorting the whole house for every state event.
- Copies only the requested room, battery sensors, security sensors, or compact toolbar/index fields. Projection work no longer holds the live-event lock while copying and translating names.
- Reuses battery metadata from the shared inventory instead of repeatedly opening the full registries. Registry refresh and live state updates continue to update it.
- Keys action catalogs to device metadata and configuration changes rather than ordinary brightness, presence, or battery readings. Catalogs contain target metadata, not stale device states.
- Reconciles each room with the returned catalog revision, preventing repeated catalog downloads when a subsection was opened with an older revision.
- Preserves current settings, migration archives, existing controls, and automation behavior.

## 0.5.3

- Completes deferred reference repairs using the approved current-settings policy: existing canonical settings win over older aliases regardless of file order.
- Archives original private settings and records older conflicting keys in the repair manifest. Ambiguous collisions without a current canonical entry still stop safely.
- Reports resolved conflict counts at startup. Existing completed migrations remain unchanged; no registry entities are deleted.

## 0.5.2

- Shares a revision-keyed action/editor catalog across Home Configurator rooms rather than rebuilding and transferring it in every room response. Revalidates after inventory or saved-setting changes.
- Renders applicable room section headers first; builds each editor only when expanded, retaining its existing DOM and drafts when closed and reopened.
- Warms button discovery independently with single-flight refresh, a short cache lock and failure backoff. Room navigation uses its last cached result; only an opened Buttons section waits for initial discovery.
- Batches registry-change bursts into a delayed metadata refresh instead of refreshing per event. Preserves state events that arrive during a full snapshot so fresh states are not overwritten.
- Keeps room responses scoped to that room's assignments. Late button discovery retrieves its saved ZHA actions as well.
- Preserves the backed-up 0.5.1 reference migration and existing automations. Physical runtime acceptance remains separate from regression tests and mounting.

## 0.5.1

- Repairs the reviewed repeated-area entity references in private saved settings before configuration generation, only when the old ID is absent and its enabled replacement is loaded.
- Consolidates saved light-group targets only when live recursive membership matches an FHT group exactly. Removes duplicate selector targets, not physical devices or unverified registry helpers.
- Preserves original saved settings and managed YAML in a private repair backup with a migration manifest. Conflicting assignments defer the entire repair; interrupted writes are restored before generators run.
- Leaves dashboard references and unverified/missing groups unchanged for separate review. Repairs run on installation/startup, not merely when this source is mounted.
- Retires the 0.4.80 stable hold at the homeowner's request, preserving its recovery archives. 0.5.1 remains pending homeowner stability acceptance.

## 0.4.100

- Keeps Home Assistant alive behind the ingress app instead of redirecting away and booting it again on exit.
- Uses a reversible fullscreen iframe popover when supported, with ordinary embedded rendering as the fallback. Exit returns to Updates through Home Assistant's client-side navigation.
- Removes the intermediate kiosk redirect document while retaining fingerprinted interface assets.
- Removes repeated registry reads and redundant inventory copying from exterior/security status requests.
- Makes unavailable exterior sensors inspectable and prevents stale closed states from producing a green bubble.
- Distinguishes Protect certificate, DNS, timeout, and refused-connection errors without exposing credentials. TLS verification remains enabled.
- Preserves stable rollback 0.4.80; this release does not repair a console's invalid certificate or alter device pairings.

## 0.4.99

- Uses a lightweight kiosk handoff instead of initializing the complete application twice.
- Separates the interface shell from fingerprinted, compressed CSS and JavaScript assets that remain cached across openings and updates safely.
- Staggers background startup requests, combines identical in-flight reads, and loads a compact menu summary instead of a full entity inventory just to count offline thermostats.
- Keeps stale-cache recovery off the navigation request path and removes repeated registry reads from lighting updates.
- Fixes live revision recovery after server restarts and accepts state events during subscription setup.
- Reserves HTTP capacity for navigation, corrects overload response framing, and handles cancelled browser requests quietly.
- Fixes forced Home Configurator refresh, refreshes staying attached to their original page, missing-temperature display, and refresh rejection handling.
- Disables the enhanced Device Alarm output picker during saves so edits are not silently discarded.
- Adds real navigation and slow-request timings, behavioral regression coverage, and an audit with 15 next-step recommendations. Stable rollback remains 0.4.80.

## 0.4.95

- Removes the nested Refrigerators card and places refrigerator door and environmental sensor cards directly inside Whole Home Device Alarms.
- Shows each sensor's current state beside its friendly name and simplifies alert timing into a compact second row.

- Adds a Whole Home Sleep source selector so only chosen bedroom Sleep modes activate the global House Sleep mode.

## 0.4.90

- Adds separate Day Mode and Night Mode action pickers to Pantry Door Actions and conditions the generated automations on the active house mode.
- Migrates existing Pantry door actions to both modes so current behavior remains intact until each picker is changed.

- Hides legacy generic All Lights and Lights helpers from action menus when the canonical FHT area group exists.
- Elevates the entire active Home Configurator floor so expanded action menus remain above later floor cards.

## 0.4.87

- Removes irrelevant Room Modes, Wake-up Routine, and Not Set status from Pantry while surfacing its live door state and assigned-action count beside the room title.
- Fixes Home Configurator action menus so they render above neighboring room and floor cards instead of being obscured.
- Removes raw entity-ID fallback text from duplicated action names while retaining clean room and device context where available.

- Deduplicated single-light rooms so Entry exposes only its singular light option instead of All Lights/Lights variants.
## 0.5.158

- Refrigerator door alarms now display each device's actual registry name instead of the generic Fridge Door label.
## 0.5.159

- Restored two-column Presence cards by allowing grouped sensors to occupy a normal card column.
- Matched Presence card typography, spacing, glass styling, and controls to Doors.
## 0.5.160

- Matched Presence action, activation-delay, and clear-delay rows to the Doors stacked layout with full-width controls.
## 0.5.161

- Changed Presence activation and clear delays to minute dropdowns from Off through 120 minutes.
- Expanded the backend delay limit to 120 minutes while preserving stored values in seconds.
## 0.5.162

- Applied the Doors timeout dropdown styling and typography to Presence activation and clear delays.
## 0.5.163

- Combined Presence groups now use full-width cards; individual Presence sensors remain two-column on tablet and desktop.
# 0.5.164

- Adds a saved multi-select Parent Presence Groups control to same-area presence sensors.
- Prevents a sensor's clear action from turning lights off while any selected parent presence group remains occupied.
- Preserves existing presence actions, delays, mode brightness settings, and approved stable rollback 0.5.23.

## 0.6.1

- Adds a Beta mode App option (off by default) and a BETA badge shown only when it is enabled.
- Documents separate Stable (`main`) and Beta (`beta` branch) update channels so only Beta subscribers receive in-development updates.
- Becomes the homeowner-approved stable release, replacing retired stable 0.5.23.

## 0.6.2

- With Beta mode on, the App checks the `beta` branch and shows "Beta X Available" when a newer Beta build is published.
- Installing a Beta update downloads it into the App's private storage and restarts only the App; the next start runs the Beta build.
- Turning Beta mode off, or installing a Stable version at least as new, starts the Stable build again.

## 0.6.3

- A local App install exports its saved settings and configuration on each start to a private transfer file in the Home Assistant configuration directory.
- A new repository install with no saved settings imports that file once on first start, applies the configuration, restarts, and deletes the transfer file.

## 0.6.4 (Beta)

- Removes the "Action" label under each Presence sensor and Presence group title; the action selector keeps an accessible name.

## 0.6.5 (Beta)

- After a Beta update, the interface checks the fast health status for the restarted App instead of the slower update status, and reloads as soon as the App is back.
- If the App has not restarted after a minute, the button says to restart it from Home Assistant; the downloaded Beta starts on that restart.
- Logs the Home Assistant response when an App restart request is refused.

## 0.6.6

- Fixes a startup loop with Beta mode on: the Beta startup script now continues in the same shell, so the "already applied" flag is kept instead of being cleared by with-contenv.
- A Beta build that has not reached a running interface after three starts is skipped and Stable starts instead, until a newer Beta build is installed.

## 0.6.7 (Beta)

- Includes Stable 0.6.6 startup fixes with the 0.6.4 and 0.6.5 Beta changes.

## 0.6.8 (Beta)

- A sensor that selects a Parent Presence Group now counts as occupancy for that group, so the group stays occupied (and its lights stay on) while only the child sensor detects presence.
- A child sensor's clear action still waits for the rest of its parent group, ignoring its own presence, so it is not blocked by itself.
- Saving a Presence sensor updates the generated group sensors and reloads templates.

## 0.6.9 (Beta)

- Saving a Presence sensor's mode percentages or on/off choices now applies them immediately when that sensor currently detects presence, instead of waiting for the next detection or mode change.

## 0.6.10 (Beta)

- A sensor whose own Home Assistant area was deleted now appears in its device's room instead of Unassigned.
- Presence groups use the same area rule as their member sensors (a sensor's own area first, then its device's), so a group and its members appear in the same room.

## 0.6.11 (Beta)

- Presence shows each area as one card with the red, green, or blue accent edge; the sensors inside are borderless sections separated by space.

## 0.6.12 (Beta)

- Presence cards warn when another presence sensor or group turns on the same lights with a different brightness for the same mode, and name that sensor and its percentage.

## 0.6.13 (Beta)

- Reworks Parent Presence Groups: a child sensor controls its own lights on and off independently, and its parent group's lights stay on while the child detects presence.
- A child no longer turns its parent group's lights on and is no longer counted in the group sensor (reverts the 0.6.8 group membership).
- When the child clears after the group has already cleared, the group's lights turn off after the group's clear delay.

## 0.6.14 (Beta)

- With Beta mode on, the header checks for a new Beta build every 20 seconds and whenever the App comes back into view.
- The App checks the beta branch's newest commit on GitHub instead of the raw file, which GitHub caches for up to five minutes; unchanged answers do not count against GitHub's request limit.
- Beta updates download the exact commit that was offered.

## 0.6.15 (Beta)

- Presence no longer shows Sleep Number (SleepIQ) bed sensors, does not group them, and does not generate presence automations for them. Any saved choices for them are kept, not deleted.

## 0.6.16 (Beta)

- Action and Presence dropdowns only offer Future Homes Tech light groups the App currently generates. Groups Home Assistant still remembers from earlier releases (such as Bedroom 5 All Lights after it became Fan Lights only) are hidden, and saved actions on them show the room's current group.

## 0.6.17 (Beta)

- On every start (including after an update), removes Future Homes Tech automations, light groups, and template sensors that Home Assistant still lists but no configuration provides anymore. Only unavailable entities with an App unique ID that appears in no configuration file are removed; removals are listed in the App log.
- Light-group cleanup matches groups by unique ID, so a renamed current group is kept and an old group with a different entity ID is removed.

## 0.6.18 (Beta)

- On every start, renames App-generated light groups and presence groups whose entity IDs lack the fht_ prefix (kept by Home Assistant from older names) to their fht_ IDs, and updates saved App settings to the new IDs.
- Presence groups are categorized under Future Homes Tech Light Groups alongside the light groups.

## 0.6.19 (Beta)

- A room whose lights form only one multi-light group (for example Bedroom 4 Fan Lights) no longer also gets an All Lights group.
- Saved actions that used a removed All Lights group move to the room's group plus any room lights outside it, so they keep controlling the same lights; the moves are listed in the App log.

## 0.6.20 (Beta)

- In a room whose lights form one group, old All Lights groups from early releases (IDs without fht_) fold into that group in dropdowns instead of reappearing beside it.
- Start-up cleanup also removes those early-release room groups when Home Assistant lists them as unavailable and no configuration provides them.

## 0.6.21 (Beta)

- A single light is no longer wrapped in its own group (for example Bedroom 6 Desk Light); it is offered as the light itself.
- Single lights no longer count as groups, so a room with Fan Lights plus one Desk Light gets Fan Lights only, without All Lights.
- Saved actions that used a removed single-light group, or a removed All Lights group, move to the actual lights so they keep controlling the same bulbs.

## 0.6.22 (Beta)

- Restores All Lights in rooms where it covers more than one group can (for example Bedroom 6: Desk Light, Fan Lights, and All Lights). Rooms whose lights are all fan bulbs still get Fan Lights only.
- Single lights remain offered as themselves, without a group of one.

## 0.6.23 (Beta)

- Start-up cleanup ignores comments when checking whether configuration still provides an entity, so replaced single-light groups (such as light.bedroom_6_desk_lights) are removed.
- Early-release room light groups of any kind (not only All Lights and Fan Lights) are removed when unavailable and no configuration provides them.

## 0.6.24 (Beta)

- Safe Cleanup's scan now lists leftover entities not made by Future Homes Tech: entities Home Assistant still lists that no integration provides, with their integration. The list is read-only; delete them in Home Assistant after review.

## 0.6.25 (Beta)

- Safe Cleanup scans no longer stop on commented-out `!include` lines or includes of files that do not exist yet; those cannot define or reference anything.
- ESPHome and Zigbee2MQTT folders are skipped, and any remaining blocking message names the file that needs review.

## 0.6.26 (Beta)

- Safe Cleanup names any configuration file it cannot read or parse instead of showing a general error.
- Unexpected maintenance errors show their type and write full details to the App log.

## 0.6.27 (Beta)

- Safe Cleanup reads included folders the way Home Assistant does: files only, skipping hidden folders such as the App's `packages/.fht-backups` configuration backups.

## 0.6.28 (Beta)

- Combined light groups keep their location words: her and his bathroom vanities combine as Bathroom Vanity Lights instead of Vanity Lights.
- Groups with exactly the same lights as a more specific group (such as Toilet Lights beside Bathroom Toilet Lights) are no longer created.
- Saved actions on the old group names move to the new groups.

## 0.6.29 (Beta)

- Presence action and Parent Presence Group lists save once when the list closes, like Doors and Switches, instead of after every checkbox. Choosing several lights quickly no longer loses choices made while a save was running.

## 0.6.30 (Beta)

- Registry and helper commands share one kept-open Home Assistant connection instead of opening a new one for each batch.
- Beta updates use a verified release manifest (RELEASE.json): only files that differ are downloaded, each pinned to the offered commit and checked against its SHA-256, instead of the whole 24 MB repository.
- A Beta that needs configuration options or system packages the installed Stable lacks is refused with a clear message.
- New optional GitHub access token option for a private repository (takes effect with the next Stable release).
- Start-up cleanup no longer deletes retired entities silently: Safe Cleanup lists them for approval, with an option to delete them automatically from then on. Deleted registry entries are recorded privately first.
- Next Stable release: the App starts automatically with Home Assistant, a watchdog restarts it if it stops responding, and the base image is pinned.
- Unexpected maintenance errors are logged without their message text, which could contain credentials.

## 0.6.31 (Beta)

- New Settings → Light Groups page: every group the App builds for each room, its lights, and why; rename a group or keep a light out of every group, and saving rebuilds the groups right away.
- Saving Presence settings re-applies brightness only to lights still at the App's previous brightness, so lights someone dimmed or turned off are left alone.
- A Beta start counts as healthy only after the App has run for three minutes, so a Beta that crashes soon after starting still falls back to Stable.
- After a repository install has the settings, a local install stops re-exporting them, and leftover settings transfer files are deleted.

## 0.6.32 (Beta)

- Internal: the action-editor light and switch catalog moved from server.py into fht_catalog.py, the first step of splitting server.py (docs/CODE_SPLIT_PLAN.md). No behavior change.

## 0.7.0 (Stable)

Homeowner-approved Stable release bringing together Beta 0.6.7–0.6.32:

- The App starts automatically with Home Assistant, a watchdog restarts it if it stops responding, and the base image is pinned (ghcr.io/home-assistant/base:3.24-2026.08.0).
- New optional GitHub access token option, needed only if the repository is made private (see docs/BETA_CHANNEL.md).
- Beta mode: checks for Beta builds every 20 seconds, installs verified small packages (RELEASE.json), refuses Betas that need a Stable update first, and falls back to Stable after repeated failed starts.
- Presence: one card per area, Parent Presence Groups hold their group's lights while a child sensor detects presence, brightness conflict warnings, saves on list close, and saves no longer override manual dimming. Sleep Number bed sensors are hidden.
- Light groups: fht_ entity IDs and one category, no single-light groups, All Lights only when it adds something, combined groups keep location words, and the new Settings → Light Groups page to preview, rename, and keep lights out of groups.
- Safe Cleanup scans real configurations, lists leftover entities not made by the App, and asks for approval before deleting retired App entities.
- One kept-open Home Assistant connection for registry work; stricter release gate (lint and browser checks).

## 0.7.1 (Beta)

- Removes the Settings → Light Groups page and its group renaming and exclusion overrides; light groups are built exactly as before that page.

## 0.7.2 (Beta)

- New Settings → Room Devices page, above Home Configurator: one card per room listing every entity's name and entity ID in two columns, with a filter by room, name, or entity ID.

## 0.7.3 (Beta)

- Room Devices drops the room name (both the App room name and the Home Assistant area name) and the "FHT - " prefix from each name, since the card title already names the room. The filter still matches full names.

## 0.7.4 (Beta)

- Room Devices hides diagnostic and configuration entities whose name or entity ID ends with Firmware, Identify, LQI, RSSI, Off transition time, On level, On transition time, On/Off transition time, Power on behavior, or Power on level.

## 0.7.5 (Beta)

- Room Devices hides every Power-on behavior entity, wherever the phrase appears in its name or entity ID (for example "Power-on behavior 2" or "Power On Behaviour (startup)"), not just at the end.

## 0.7.6 (Beta)

- Room Devices no longer shows the Bridges room.
- Room Devices also hides entities whose name or entity ID ends with Battery type or Battery voltage (Identify was already hidden).

## 0.7.7 (Beta)

- Room Devices shows each entity's current state (with its unit, such as 71.5 °F) as a small tag in front of its name: green for on/open, grey for off/closed, red for unavailable/unknown.

## 0.7.8 (Beta)

- Fixed: choosing the first actions for a presence sensor that had none (a new sensor, or one whose actions were cleared) now turns every mode on at 100% again. The page read the card's "no actions" marker as if actions already existed, so the defaults were skipped.

## 0.7.9 (Beta)

- Camera sensors are no longer treated as presence. Any sensor on a device that has a camera (UniFi Protect, Frigate, Reolink and similar), or whose name says Camera or Doorbell, is left off the Presence page and out of the automatic presence groups. Saved presence actions on a camera sensor stay saved but no longer run. UniFi Protect sensors without a camera, such as the UP-Sense, still count.

## 0.7.10 (Beta)

- Doors and Presence load much faster: one request now carries every room's door sensors, mode options and saved settings, so the pages no longer make a separate request for each room (three at a time) while the progress bar fills. Switches already worked this way.

## 0.7.11 (Beta)

- Room Modes: ticking a mode now opens a pop-up with that mode's settings for that room (for example "Maverick's Bedroom · Toddler"). Toddler shows its own panel (monitored door, alert lights and colour, chimes, repeats, auto-off, Inovelli LED); every other mode shows its Room Scene (lights, brightness, colour). A gear next to each ticked mode reopens its pop-up.
- Removed the hidden Device Health and Action Timeline leftovers, including the background recording of every state change that only fed them.
- Removed page code that was never called (four functions) and two unused server helpers.

## 0.7.12 (Beta)

- Fixed: on Doors, choosing an action in a room with a display name (Maverick's Bedroom, Chloe's Bedroom…) showed "A door and its mode settings are required." The 0.7.10 snapshot keyed each room's mode options by display name while the page looked them up by the Home Assistant area name, so no mode rows rendered. The rows now always render, with Day/Night/Whole Home Sleep as the fallback.

## 0.7.13 (Beta)

- The App package is about 2.5 MB instead of 8.5 MB: the red and green backgrounds are now WebP and the colour logos are 256 px.
- Removed the "coming soon" Shades and Climate entries from the main menu and the Amazon Alexa and Google Nest tabs. Voice Control opens Apple HomeKit directly; climate settings stay under Settings → Climate.
- The App configuration page now shows names and descriptions for Verify Protect certificate, Protect CA certificate and Entry delay webhook ID.
- The one-time saved-reference repair from 0.5.1 no longer runs at every start.

## 0.7.14 (Beta)

- Exhaust fans can follow a humidity sensor: on Settings → Switches, each exhaust fan timer row gains a same-room **Humidity sensor** picker with **Start above** and **Stop below** levels. The fan turns on when humidity rises above the start level and off once the room has stayed below the stop level for two minutes. The manual timer still works as before and no longer cuts short a humidity-started run, nor turns off a hand-started fan while the room is still humid.

## 0.7.15 (Beta)

- Site profile: this home's Protect console address, time zone, weather entity and room/door naming rules now live in `site_profile.json`, with an optional per-installation override in `/data/site_profile.json`, so the same App can run in another home without code changes. Nothing changes for this home. Settings → Unifi shows the active profile read-only; every key is documented in docs/SITE_PROFILE.md.

## 0.7.16 (Beta)

- Alarm → Device Sensors gains **Door Left Open** reminders for any door or window sensor, grouped by room: a delay, Any time / Night / Night and Sleep timing, and siren, chime, notification and UniFi webhook outputs. The reminder clears when the door closes, and a Night reminder also fires if the house enters Night while the door has already been open too long.

## 0.7.17 (Beta)

- Phone alerts through the Home Assistant Companion app: Settings → Alarm → Device Sensors lists every signed-in phone with a **Send test** button, and each refrigerator door and temperature alert gains "Phone: …" tick boxes beside the sirens and chimes. The bedroom Armed Away and Armed Stay Kids panels (Room Modes pop-up) gain the same tick boxes, so a door opening while armed can notify a phone even without a UniFi webhook. Phones are off by default; the notice clears itself when the door closes or the temperature drops.

## 0.7.18 (Beta)

- Wake Up routines are set up from Settings → Room Modes: turn on **Wake Up** for a room (or press its gear) to edit the days, time, actions, brightness and override time in the pop-up.
- Fixed: wake routines at 10:00 or later no longer stop the room's wake automation from loading (times are now quoted in the generated package).
- Fixed: a wake routine whose light or speaker has been renamed, or has not loaded yet, no longer blocks the App's start-up activation or other rooms' wake saves; the App logs which devices are missing and keeps the routine.
- Fixed: saving a wake routine with a Room Mode action no longer re-declares the room's mode helper (no more "duplicate key" package error or extra reload on every start and save).
- Fixed: a rare start-up deadlock between the HomeKit bridge settings and other configuration saves.
- Fixed: opening the App long after it started now loads the battery level and exterior door status straight away.

## 0.7.19 (Beta)

- Every saved settings file keeps its last 20 versions, and the Doors, Switches, Buttons, Presence, Room Modes, Scenes, Alarm, Home Configurator and Apple HomeKit pages gain an **Undo last change** pill showing when that change was made. Press it to see what changed and put the page's settings back; the generated automations are rebuilt to match. Undoing an undo redoes it.

## 0.7.20 (Beta)

- Presence and Doors: each mode rule can set a light tone after its brightness — Current, Warm (2700 K), Neutral (4000 K), Cool (5500 K), Adaptive (follows daylight) or a custom Kelvin — applied together with the brightness to lights that support it. Existing rules stay on Current, so nothing changes until you pick a tone.

## 0.7.21 (Beta)

- Internal: the sixteen settings stores now share one base class (261 fewer lines in server.py). Saved files, return values and generated packages are unchanged; verified by a before/after comparison of every store.

## 0.7.22 (Beta)

- Removed the hidden header arm-mode, Exterior Doors and Battery Inventory indicators with their dialogs, the `/api/batteries`, `/api/battery-types` and `/api/security/entry-status` routes and the battery-type store (about 1,200 lines). The Unifi Protect Arm Mode panel and the Security page are unchanged. The saved `battery_type_assignments.json` is left on disk.

## 0.7.23 (Beta)

- Housekeeping: the stale ROADMAP.md no longer ships in the package; design mock-ups, original logo files and orphaned developer scripts were removed from the repository.

## 0.7.24 (Beta)

- "Undo last change" moves off the individual settings pages into one **Revert Changes** card at the bottom of Home Configurator. It lists the recent saves from every settings page (which page, what changed, when) with a **Revert** button on each. A revert is itself listed as a change, so it can be reverted again.

## 0.7.25 (Beta)

- Doors: in one-column (phone) layout a blue line now separates the doors inside a room card; in two-column layout each door becomes its own card with the left highlight.

## 0.7.26 (Beta)

- Removed the Alarm page's Door Sensors tab and its unused per-mode door selections (nothing generated automations from them; the saved file is left on disk), so Alarm opens directly on Device Sensors. Removed the unreachable Pantry-only door colour cards from Doors; every door uses the shared mode rows with the tone picker.

## 0.7.27 (Beta)

- Room Devices: every state tag is now the same width, with the text centred, so the names line up down the page.

## 0.7.28 (Beta)

- Room Devices: the state tag is wide enough for "unavailable", and entities without a state show a blank tag so every name lines up.

## 0.7.29 (Beta)

- New Settings → **Environment** page, just before Presence: every exhaust fan grouped by room with its auto-off timer and its humidity sensor, start and stop levels. These controls have moved there from the Switches rows, which now show only the fan's actions.

## 0.7.30 (Beta)

- Switches, Doors and Presence: a collapsed action picker no longer repeats the room name the card already shows — in Master Bedroom, "Master Bedroom Bathroom Toilet" reads "Bathroom Toilet". The open list is unchanged.

## 0.7.31 (Beta)

- Internal: the stylesheet lost about 770 lines — 120 rules for classes nothing uses, 28 dead selectors and 15 folded duplicates. A computed-style comparison of every page at desktop and phone widths showed no visual change.

## 0.7.32 (Beta)

- The header shows how long the App took to open, under the version: **Server** (until the App answered), **Page** (until the page was drawn) and **Data** (until the first data arrived). Hover it for the explanation.
- Door Left Open reminders are now part of the settings history, so their changes appear in Home Configurator → Revert Changes under Alarm.

## 0.7.33 (Beta)

- The header's opening times are stacked one per line so they fit inside the sidebar.

## 0.7.34 (Beta)

- Environment now looks and lays out exactly like Switches: centred room headings, one glass card per exhaust fan with the blue left edge, two columns on wide screens and one on phones, the same top bar and loading bar. Every Switches style rule now also applies to Environment, so the two pages stay in step.

## 0.7.35 (Beta)

- Environment: the current humidity next to the sensor reads just "46%" instead of "Now 46%".

## 0.7.36 (Beta)

- Environment: each fan card is named after the fan instead of the switch channel it is wired to ("Laundry Switch Switch 3" reads "Exhaust Fan"; in Master Bedroom, "Bathroom Toilet Exhaust Fan"), and the humidity reading is plain white.

## 0.7.37 (Beta)

- Environment: a fan in a room with no humidity sensor shows only its timer; the Humidity sensor, Start above and Stop below fields are hidden.

## 0.7.38 (Beta)

- Environment: exhaust fans can follow a presence sensor in their room. When the room has one, the fan card shows **Presence sensor**, **Activation delay** (how long someone must be there before the fan starts, default 2 minutes) and **Clear delay** (how long it keeps running after the room clears, default 5 minutes). Nothing runs until a sensor is chosen. A humid room keeps the fan running past the clear delay. "Exhaust fan timer" is renamed **Manual fan timer**; it only arms when the fan is switched on by hand and never turns the fan off while someone is still in the room.

## 0.7.39 (Beta)

- New **Settings → Future Tech Portal**: Home Assistant pushes device status to the Future Tech Portal. Paste the portal token once and the App stores it only in Home Assistant's secrets.yaml (`future_tech_token`), writes `packages/future_tech_portal.yaml`, reloads Home Assistant and sends the first inventory. Reports: the full inventory 60 seconds after start and hourly (at most 150 devices per request), device offline after 2 minutes unavailable and recovered, low battery below 20% once per device a day, and a heartbeat every 10 minutes. Home Assistant only sends; the portal cannot control anything. The page shows the connection (green when reports are arriving, red when they are not or the token is rejected), the last report, devices reported, which integrations report, Send inventory now, and Remove token. Failed reports raise a "Future Tech Portal" notification with the status code only; a rejected token pauses automatic reports until a new token is saved. See docs/FUTURE_TECH_PORTAL.md.
- The Settings menu stays open on Room Devices and Environment.

## 0.7.40 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: the App's Configuration tab gets **Future Tech Portal token** and **Future Tech Portal URL**, right under the Protect API key. A token entered there is copied into Home Assistant's secrets.yaml when the App starts, the reporting package is installed and the first inventory is sent; the Settings page then shows that the token comes from the Configuration tab. The URL defaults to `https://futuretech.studio/api/beta/ingest` and must be https. Both are optional, so Beta still installs over Stable 0.7.0; the two fields appear in the Configuration tab once Stable includes them.
- Fix the App option descriptions: the translations file was not valid YAML (the Beta mode description), so Home Assistant could not show any option names or descriptions.

## 0.7.41 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: the inventory goes in one request (up to the portal's 500 devices, split only to stay under 256 KB) instead of chunks of 150. The portal treats each inventory as the complete list, so earlier chunks showed as "status unknown, missing from the last report".

## 0.7.42 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal activity: each inventory also sends the home's automations (`kind: "automations"`: automationId, name, enabled, configId, lastTriggeredAt), and a new "Future Tech - activity" automation reports every automation run as it happens (`automation.triggered` event with automationId, name, source and occurredAt). The portal's own automations are left out, and reports go one at a time to stay within the portal's rate limit. See docs/FUTURE_TECH_PORTAL.md for the payloads.

## 0.7.43 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal moves into **Home Configurator**, as a card at the bottom below Revert Changes, styled like the Whole Home and Revert Changes cards (blue-edged card, framed blocks, pill buttons, Room Names-style token box). The separate Settings page is removed.

## 0.7.44 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal inventory: each device now says which Home Assistant integration it comes from: `integration` (for example `zha`, `unifiprotect`), `integrationName` (its name in Home Assistant), and `integrations` when a device belongs to more than one.

## 0.7.45 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: `lastSeenAt` is now when a device was really last seen. Online devices report the time of the report; offline devices report the last time they were online, kept across Home Assistant restarts (a restart used to make long-offline devices look "offline since" the restart). Devices already offline are filled in from Home Assistant's history (up to 10 days) when the App starts or an inventory is sent by hand. `device.offline` events also carry `lastSeenAt`.

## 0.7.46 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: a device's `integration` is now the integration that created it. Helpers that wrap another integration's entity, such as Switch as X, are never reported (Matter Wi-Fi switches shown as lights through Switch as X were reported as `switch_as_x`), and the device's own entity is used as its main entity.
- Future Tech Portal: UniFi Network switches and access points that UniFi lists as disconnected are reported offline. UniFi keeps their entities available, so the device's State sensor (`disconnected`, `heartbeat_missed`) now decides, in the inventory and for live offline/recovered events.

## 0.7.47 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: Matter devices now say which network they use, `network`: `thread`, `wifi` or `ethernet`, so the portal can separate Matter over Thread from Matter over Wi-Fi. The App reads it from the Matter integration's diagnostics when it starts and on Send inventory now; bridged devices take their bridge's network.

## 0.7.48 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: the inventory no longer sends a list of the home's automations (`kind: "automations"`). Only automation runs are reported, each as it happens (`automation.triggered`).

## 0.7.49 (Beta)

- Scenes → Light Automations now also lists lights that have no group of their own, such as a single porch or side-yard light, beside the room's groups (Outside All Lights, Outside Coach Lights). The light-group generator offers a lone light as itself instead of a one-light group, so those lights were missing; rooms with only one light are listed too. Schedules can be saved for them, and they stay listed after saving.

## 0.7.50 (Beta)

- House Mode Status no longer runs every minute. It set the house mode 1,440 times a day; it now runs only when the mode can change: at sunrise and sunset (with your offsets), when a bedroom enters or leaves Sleep, and when Home Assistant starts.
- Room Devices uses the same header as Doors, Switches and Environment.

## 0.7.51 (Beta)

- Fix the Mac Home Assistant app crashing when a light schedule's time of day is opened: the schedule card used the system time wheel, which the Mac app can't show. It now uses the App's own time picker (hour, minute, AM/PM), like Climate and Wake routines.
- Future Tech Portal: every inventory now carries `system` with the App version (`appVersion`, the Beta build when Beta mode is on), Home Assistant Core (`coreVersion`), Supervisor (`supervisorVersion`) and OS (`osVersion`), for the portal's System → Home Assistant card.

## 0.7.52 (Beta)

- Light Automations move from Scenes into **Home Configurator**, as the last section at the bottom, styled like the rest of Home Configurator: a centered "Light Automations" heading with the number enabled, one blue-edged card per room like Whole Home, framed light cards, and the same dropdowns. Scenes now shows Room Scenes.
- Room Devices is at most two columns wide (one on narrow screens).

## 0.7.53 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: the inventory's `system` block now lists every installed Home Assistant App (add-on) with its version, whether an update is waiting and its state (`apps`), and everything installed through HACS with its version, plus custom integrations HACS doesn't manage (`hacs`).
- Switches and Environment use the Doors layout: rooms sit two to a row; a room with one device takes one column, and a room with more spans the row with its devices in two columns.

## 0.7.54 (Beta)

- The App colour now recolours every card edge. On Doors, the separate door cards in a two-door room and the line between doors in a room stayed blue when red or green was chosen; card edges, accent lines, the loading spinner and outline buttons on every page now follow the App colour.

## 0.7.55 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: installed Apps and HACS items are sent in the format the portal expects, as their own report after each inventory: `{"kind": "apps", "appVersion": ..., "apps": [{appId, name, source, version, latestVersion, updateAvailable, state, category}]}`. `source` is `addon`, `hacs` or `custom`; HACS items now include their latest version and whether an update is waiting. They are no longer part of the inventory's `system` block.
- The apps report goes once a day with the hourly inventory; Send inventory now (or running the inventory script yourself) always sends it.
- The Dashboard uses the same header as Room Devices and Home Configurator: no bar, just the update and exit buttons in the corner.

## 0.7.56 (Beta)

- Environment is renamed **Environmental**. The refrigerator sensors stay on the Alarm page (0.7.55 had moved them to Environmental by mistake).

## 0.7.57 (Beta)

- Lighting and Security use the same header as Room Devices, Home Configurator and the Dashboard.
- Room Devices shows the loading bar at the top while it loads, like Switches and Environmental.

## 0.7.58 (Beta)

- Doors: a door's timeout now turns the lights off even when the timer was cut short. A Home Assistant restart, an App restart or update, or saving settings (which reloads automations) used to cancel a pending timeout, so a door left open kept its lights on. Each door automation now also checks how long the door has been open and turns the lights off once the timeout has passed, within about a minute.
- Doors: a door sensor coming back from unavailable no longer counts as the door opening.
- Future Tech Portal: **Send app versions now**, next to Send inventory now, sends only the installed Apps and HACS versions straight away, however many were sent today. The Connection card shows **Last app versions**, the last time the portal accepted them.

## 0.7.59 (Beta)

- New Betas show up in the header reliably. The App asked GitHub for the newest Beta every 15–20 seconds while it was open, even in a background tab. Without a GitHub access token, GitHub allows 60 requests an hour from one home, so it refused for most of each hour, and the header couldn't see new Betas. The App now asks every two minutes, and when you open it if the last check is a minute old. If GitHub still refuses, the App waits as long as GitHub asks, keeps offering a Beta it already found, and shows why on the BETA badge's tooltip.
- Setting **GitHub access token** in the App's Configuration tab removes GitHub's limit (a fine-grained token with read-only access to public repositories is enough).

## 0.7.60 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: HACS items are reported under the name HACS shows, such as "HACS" and "Alexa Media Player", instead of their GitHub repository name ("integration", "alexa_media_player"). HACS items are still found when HACS keeps its records only in its newer `hacs.data` file.

## 0.7.61 (Beta)

- Environmental: an exhaust fan with a presence sensor now runs once for a set time. When the activation delay ends, the fan turns on and a Home Assistant timer starts for the **Run time** (previously "Clear delay", 1 to 60 minutes). When the timer finishes, the fan turns off. Seeing someone again during the run no longer restarts or extends it, as the old clear delay did. The timer keeps running through settings saves, App restarts and Home Assistant restarts. Switching the fan off by hand ends the run. A paired humidity sensor still keeps a humid room's fan running until the air is dry.
- Beta mode looks for a new Beta every minute. Without a GitHub access token it reads GitHub's git branch list, which is never cached and doesn't count toward GitHub's limit of 60 checks an hour. With Beta mode off, the App asks Home Assistant for a Stable update once an hour.

## 0.8.1

- Stable release of everything through Beta 0.7.61: Future Tech Portal reporting (inventory, app versions with Send app versions now, automation activity), the door timeout backup, the exhaust fan run timer, reliable Beta update checks, and the interface changes from the 0.7.x Betas.

## 0.8.2 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: events are sent every 5 minutes instead of one at a time. Automation runs, offline, recovered and low battery events go into one queue, each keeping its own `eventId` and `occurredAt`. Every 5 minutes the queue goes out as `{"kind": "events", "appVersion": …, "events": [ … ]}`, in requests of up to 500 (sooner once 500 are waiting). A heartbeat goes out only when a window has nothing else to send. A 429, a 5xx or no answer keeps the events for the next send, and a 401 or 403 still pauses sending until a new token is saved. The queue holds at most 2,000 events or about 240,000 characters, dropping the oldest, and drops events older than 7 days. It survives restarts, and Home Assistant's history database doesn't store it. The Connection card shows how many events are waiting.

## 0.8.3 (Beta)

- The **Beta X Available** (and **Update Available**) button shows in the header again on every page. Since the shared corner header (0.7.55–0.7.57), the Dashboard, Doors, Switches, Lighting, Security, Environmental, Room Devices, Presence and Home Configurator headers hid every button except Updates and Exit, including the update button, so a waiting Beta only showed on Scenes. It now sits in the corner, to the left of Updates.

## 0.8.4

- Stable release of everything through Beta 0.8.3: Future Tech Portal events sent every 5 minutes from one queue, and the **Beta X Available** and **Update Available** button showing in the header on every page again.

## 0.8.6 (Beta)

- A room whose lights are all plain numbered lights (Dining Room Light 1 to 5, Pantry Light 1 and 2, Closet 1 Light 1 to 3, Upstairs Hallway Light 1 and 2) now gets one **Dining Room Lights** group instead of **All Lights**, and Lighting shows it under that full name. The group keeps its `light.fht_<room>_all_lights` ID, so saved switch actions, scenes and automations keep working. Rooms with other lights too (Kitchen) still get **All Lights**.
- Lighting shows every light again. A light that is in no group except the room's whole-room group now gets its own control: Porch Light, Side Yard Light and Backyard Light on the Outside card, a bedroom lamp, and the only light in Entry, Stairway or Laundry Room. Before, single lights only appeared through All Lights.
- Lighting only shows groups the App still writes. An old group that Home Assistant still remembers, such as Bedroom 6 All Lights from before that room became **Bedroom 6 Fan Lights**, no longer appears next to the current group.
- A bedroom with its own bathroom (Master Bedroom Bathroom Shower Light, Bathtub Light, Toilet Lights, Vanity Lights) gets a **Master Bedroom All Bathroom Lights** group with every bathroom light, toilet included. The Shower and Bathtub lights still have their own controls too. Rooms named Bathroom don't get it, because their All Lights already is the bathroom.

## 0.8.7

- Stable release of everything through Beta 0.8.6 (the Lighting groups and standalone lights) plus the change below.
- **Update Available** installs a Stable update in place, the way the Beta button does, instead of opening Home Assistant's Updates page. The App asks Home Assistant to install it through the App's update entity, shows **Updating to X…**, and reloads once the new version answers. If Home Assistant can't start the update, the button reads **Update Failed — Open Updates** and opens the Updates page on the next click.

## 0.8.8 (Beta)

- Pages show the thin loading bar at the top while they load, instead of a **Loading …** line. Lighting now has the same bar as Doors, Switches, Environmental and Presence, and its room cards appear once they are ready rather than half loaded. Room Devices drops its **Loading room devices…** line under the bar it already had. Security, Scenes, Room Modes, Climate and Buttons swap their loading lines for the same bar. Errors and "nothing found" messages still show as before.

## 0.8.9 (Beta)

- Lighting: inside a room's card, the room's group reads **Lights** again ("Dining Room Lights" shows as **Lights** under the Dining Room heading), the same way Fan Lights and All Lights drop the room name.

## 0.8.10 (Beta)

- The sidebar no longer shows the **Server / Page / Data** opening times under the version. The version, the BETA badge and the temperature stay.

## 0.8.11 (Beta)

- Each settings page (Home Configurator, Doors, Switches, Presence, Alarm, Buttons, Room Modes, Scenes and Apple HomeKit) has a **Revert** button in its header, left of Updates. It opens a **Revert Changes** card listing only that page's recent saves (what changed, when) with a **Revert** button on each. A revert is itself listed as a change, so it can be reverted again, and the page reloads with the restored settings.
- The **Revert Changes** card at the bottom of Home Configurator is removed; the header button replaces it.
- Light Automations changes are listed under Home Configurator, where they are edited, instead of under Scenes.

## 0.8.12 (Beta)

- No visible change. The Home Assistant WebSocket client (the handshake, frames, and the one shared connection that registry, light group, and maintenance commands reuse) moved out of `server.py` into `fht_ha_client.py`, the first step of `docs/CODE_SPLIT_PLAN.md`.

## 0.8.13 (Beta)

- Users: recurring hours can run overnight. An **Until** time earlier than **From** carries into the next morning, and the checked days are the days a shift starts (a Saturday 22:00–06:00 shift allows Sunday 05:59, not Sunday night). Older versions deny an overnight schedule rather than misread it.
- Users: People has a filter for Everyone, Active, Upcoming, Disabled, Expired and Archived. Guests count as Active during a confirmed stay, Upcoming before one and Expired after their last one. Each card shows that state.
- Users: a profile can be linked to a Home Assistant person (optional, one profile per person). If Home Assistant people can't be loaded, the existing link is kept. Deleting a profile clears the link. Home Assistant accounts are still never created or changed.
- Users: rooms on a confirmed stay change only through **Move rooms**, which asks for the new rooms, the access groups that should apply there (not carried over automatically), a reason and a confirmed review. The move checks the new rooms are free for the rest of the stay, keeps the guest's PIN, and is listed on the stay and in Activity. Draft stays still edit rooms directly.
- Users: when the private Users database is restored from a backup or moved to new hardware, PINs issued before then are held, and Users shows a review banner. **Revoke earlier PINs** retires them; **Keep earlier PINs** accepts them after review. PINs issued after the restore work straight away. A restart or update does not trigger it. A database last opened by 0.8.12 or older carries no marker, so restoring one of those is not detected. No schema change: Stable 0.8.4 still opens the same database.

## 0.8.14 (Beta)

- Lighting: a room whose only lights are the numbered bulbs of one fixture now shows **Light**, not **Lights**: Dining Room (Light 1 to 5), Pantry (Light 1 and 2), Closet 1 (Light 1 to 3) and Upstairs Hallway (Light 1 and 2). The group is named "Dining Room Light" in Home Assistant and keeps its `light.fht_<room>_all_lights` ID, so saved actions and automations keep working. An old "Dining Room Lights" helper still folds into it. Rooms with other lights too (Kitchen) are unchanged.
- Lighting: each room card has white **Off** and **On** buttons on either side of its title that turn every light in the room off or on, and the **All Lights** row is gone. Below the title the card lists each light group and each light that isn't in a group. The buttons don't change with the lights' state. They're quick triggers.

## 0.8.15 (Beta)

- After **Update Available** installs an update, Home Assistant opens the App again instead of staying on the dashboard it switched to while the update re-registered the App's panel, and the App reopens on the page you were on. A Beta update reload also returns to the same page instead of the Dashboard.

## 0.8.16 (Beta)

- Undoes 0.8.14's Lighting changes while a crash on the Lighting page is investigated. The room cards go back to their All Lights row with no Off and On buttons, and one-fixture rooms read **Lights** again. Everything else, including 0.8.15's return to the same page after an update, is unchanged.

## 0.8.17 (Beta)

- Room Devices: the status tag (on, off, unavailable, readings) before each name is gone. Each row shows just the name and the entity ID.

## 0.8.18 (Beta)

- Settings has a new **Portal Configurator** page, right under Home Configurator. The **Future Tech Portal** card (connection, portal token, what is reported, UniFi Protect alarms) moved there from Home Configurator and works the same way.
- Portal Configurator has the **Revert** button in its header like the other settings pages. It lists changes to **Send reports** and the reported integrations; the portal token is never part of the history.

## 0.8.19 (Beta)

- Doors: the page stays one column at every width, desktop included. Rooms stack one under another, and a room with several doors keeps them in one card, one under another, separated by a blue line. Switches and Environment are unchanged.

## 0.8.20 (Beta)

- Lighting shows two columns of room cards on an iPad in portrait (768–820 px wide), and three on a wide landscape screen. The cards re-flow as soon as the window is resized or the iPad is turned. Before, anything up to 820 px wide was forced into one column. Phones (under 600 px) still use one column.

## 0.8.21 (Beta)

- Light groups that are one fixture with several bulbs now read singular: **Dining Room Light** and **Pantry Light** (and any room whose only lights are numbered bulbs), every **Fan Light**, and **Under Cabinet Light**. **All Lights**, **Can Lights**, **Bar Lights** and **Coach Lights** stay plural. The group IDs don't change, so saved actions and automations keep working, and an old "Dining Room Lights" helper still folds into the new group. The Off/On room buttons from 0.8.14 stay out for now.

## 0.8.22 (Beta)

- Lighting: the first row of room cards now starts below the page header instead of sitting under it.

## 0.8.23 (Beta)

- Security is now a UniFi Protect page. It shows every camera, doorbell, sensor, floodlight and lock that Home Assistant's UniFi Protect integration provides, each with its area, whether it is online or recording, and the live state of its sensors (motion, person and vehicle detection, doorbell rings, contact, temperature, battery). Cameras and doorbells show a snapshot that refreshes every 10 seconds while the page is open.
- The page only reads. It has no arm, disarm, privacy or recording controls, and Protect's settings and diagnostics stay out. Door sensors from other integrations are on the Doors page, and the HomeKit security bridge is unchanged.

## 0.8.24 (Beta)

- Room Devices: on a phone, each row shows the name with the entity ID on its own line underneath, and the Name and Entity ID headings are hidden. Wider screens keep the two columns.

## 0.8.25 (Beta)

- Lighting: on a phone the first room card now starts below the Menu, Updates and Exit buttons instead of under them, with a little more room on iPad and desktop too.

## 0.8.26 (Beta)

- Every settings and menu page now starts its content below the page header and its Menu, Updates and Exit buttons, on phones, iPads and desktop: Lighting, Security, Room Devices, Home Configurator, Portal Configurator, Doors, Switches, Environmental and Presence. Before, the first card or status line on these pages sat under the header. The Dashboard is unchanged. A new browser test checks every menu page at five screen widths.

## 0.8.27 (Beta)

- Security: tap a camera or doorbell snapshot to open a live view in a pop-up. The video comes from Home Assistant's camera stream for that camera and stops as soon as the pop-up closes (the close button, Escape, tapping outside, leaving the page or switching away from the App). Up to three live views can be open at once across all screens, and each one closes itself after 10 minutes. The pop-up only shows video; it has no camera controls.
- Security: each camera card, and the live-view pop-up, now lists only what is being detected right now (motion, a person, a vehicle, a doorbell press...). A detection appears when it starts and disappears when it ends; a camera with nothing going on reads **Nothing detected right now**. Protect sensors (UP-Sense) also keep their temperature, humidity, light and battery readings. A closed contact sensor shows nothing, and an offline device lists nothing.
- Security: a camera's disabled or unavailable sensors (for example a turned-off **Speaking Detected**) never appear on the page or in the pop-up.

## 0.8.28 (Beta)

- Security: the camera live-view pop-up and the camera cards follow the App color. Their borders and the pop-up's close circle are red in red mode, green in green mode and blue in blue mode. Detections that are happening stay green in every mode.

## 0.8.29 (Beta)

- Apple HomeKit: a device checked under Voice Control now always reaches its HomeKit bridge. On each start the App compares the bridge file with the saved checkboxes and rewrites it when they differ, then reloads Home Assistant's YAML so HomeKit picks it up. Before, a device whose Home Assistant ID had been renamed elsewhere (for example the Upstairs Hallway thermostat in the 0.5.1 reference repair) stayed checked on the page while the bridge still listed its old, missing ID, so it never appeared in Apple Home.

## 0.8.30 (Beta)

- Lighting has a new look: counts of lights on, rooms lit and offline lights at the top, rooms grouped by floor, and one row per light that fills to its brightness. Drag a row sideways to dim it, tap its switch to turn it on or off, or use **All off** (it asks first). Tapping or scrolling past a row never changes a light.
- Lighting: **Classic view** at the top brings back the previous room cards on that device; **New view** switches back. Each device remembers its choice.
- Lighting opens instantly with the lights this device saw last time, then shows the live states a moment later; taps wait until the live states arrive.
- The App spends about a third less work reading everything from Home Assistant after it starts, so the first page load after an update is quicker.

## 0.8.31 (Beta)

- Security: the camera live view works. 0.8.27 showed **Live view unavailable** because Home Assistant's continuous camera stream can't pass through the Supervisor connection the App uses: it waits for a stream that never ends. The pop-up now loads fresh pictures from the camera one after another, up to about two a second, with a red **Live** tag while it runs. It stops loading the moment the pop-up closes.

## 0.8.32 (Beta)

- Security: tapping a camera or doorbell opens Home Assistant's own camera window, the same one as on the device page, with live video and sound. The App steps out of full screen while it is open and comes back when you close it. Opened outside Home Assistant, the App's own picture-by-picture view is used instead.
- Security: the cards show just the device name. The line under it with the device type and room (**Camera · Kitchen**, **Sensor · Entry**) is gone.

## 0.8.33 (Beta)

- Security: tapping a camera or doorbell opens the App's own pop-up (App-colored border, close circle, current detections underneath) with Home Assistant's live player inside, so it has live video and sound like the device page. If Home Assistant's player can't be loaded, Home Assistant's own camera window opens as before; outside Home Assistant, the App's picture-by-picture view is used.

## 0.8.34 (Beta)

- Updates: in Beta mode, the header no longer offers a Stable update that is older than the Beta you are running. Before, a waiting Stable (such as 0.8.7) took the button's place, so **Update Available** installed Stable 0.8.7 instead of offering the newest Beta. A Stable is still offered when it is newer than both the running Beta and any waiting Beta.

## 0.8.35 (Beta)

- Presence: a sensor set as a child of a Parent Presence Group (for example a Toilet Presence under a bathroom group) holds the group's lights on only while it reads **on**. Before, a child that went offline or unknown counted as occupied forever, so the group's lights never turned off. A child going offline after the group has cleared now lets the lights turn off after the clear delay, the same as a child clearing.

## 0.8.36 (Beta)

- Future Tech Portal: clears Home Assistant's leftover "Future Tech - activity uses an unknown action" repair (rest_command.future_tech_report). The activity automation hasn't called that action since 0.8.2, but Home Assistant keeps the repair until it is confirmed. The App now confirms these repairs for the portal automations once the report command is back, and if Home Assistant can't load the command until it restarts, it shows a notification asking for a restart instead.
- Future Tech Portal: turning reports off now removes the automations before the report command, so no automation runs in between and raises the same repair.
- Future Tech Portal: when the App removes the portal package, its log now says why (reports turned off, or no future_tech_token in secrets.yaml).

## 0.8.37 (Beta)

- Matter: every Matter device now carries its Home Assistant name on the device itself (its node label), so Apple Home, Google Home and the maker's app show the same name. The App writes the names shortly after it starts, within a minute of renaming a device in Home Assistant, and every 15 minutes in case a device was renamed elsewhere. Devices behind a Matter bridge get the name on their bridge entry. Offline devices are renamed when they come back; a device that doesn't allow renaming keeps its name and is noted in the App log.

## 0.8.38 (Beta)

- Apple HomeKit: the App no longer restarts your HomeKit bridges when it regenerates light groups. It used to ask Home Assistant to reload all YAML, which also reloads every HomeKit bridge. When one of those reloads failed, Home Assistant left the bridge stopped ("cannot be unloaded … FAILED_UNLOAD"), so it dropped off the network and Apple Home lost its devices until Home Assistant restarted. The App now reloads only the light groups and their names. A changed HomeKit selection takes effect at the next Home Assistant restart, as the Apple HomeKit page already says.

## 0.8.39 (Beta)

- Lighting: every room now shows under the floor its Home Assistant area is assigned to. Rooms whose lights are App light groups (such as Dining Room Light) had no floor of their own and could land under the wrong heading; their floor now comes from the room's area, the same as every other light in it.
- Lighting and every other page: moving an area to another floor, or a device to another area, in Home Assistant now shows in the App within about 15 seconds. Home Assistant saves those changes a few seconds after announcing them, so the App now reads them again once they are saved instead of keeping the old floor until it restarted.

## 0.8.40 (Beta)

- Lighting: each room now has All on and All off buttons in its header, in place of the "2 on" count. The room's All Lights row is gone from the Lighting page, so turning on one light (Kitchen Bar Lights) no longer makes the room read as all lights on. Every light in the room still has its own row. The All Lights group stays in Home Assistant, so schedules, scenes, buttons and HomeKit that use it keep working.

## 0.8.41 (Beta)

- Lighting: the on/off switch is gone from each light. Tap the light itself to turn it on or off; the highlighted color shows which lights are on. Drag sideways across a light to set its brightness, as before; a drag or a scroll never toggles the light.
- Lighting: a plain on/off light that is on now reads **100%** with a full bar, instead of **Off**.

## 0.8.42 (Beta)

- Lighting: a room shows only the All on or All off button it can use. When every light in the room is off you see just All on, when they're all on just All off, and a room whose lights are all offline shows neither. Before, the button with nothing to do was greyed out.
- Lighting: All on turns each light on at the brightness its presence sensor uses in the current mode (Day, Night or Sleep, or the room's own mode such as Sleep when it's turned on for that room), including the Kelvin tone when one is set. A light no presence sensor covers comes back at its last brightness.

## 0.8.43 (Beta)

- Lighting: a light that can only turn on and off (not dim) no longer shows a brightness bar. Its row reads **On** or **Off**, a tap switches it, and dragging across it does nothing. In Classic view its card has no brightness button. Lights that can dim keep the bar and the drag to set brightness.

## 0.8.44 (Beta)

- Sidebar: a weather icon now sits next to the outdoor temperature, showing today's forecast from your Home Assistant weather entity (sun, clouds, rain, storms, snow, fog or wind).
- Sidebar: when it is raining, a small **Raining** card (or **Heavy rain** / **Thunderstorms**) appears under the temperature. It goes away on its own when the rain stops.
- Sidebar: today's air quality shows as an **AQI** badge, colored by the EPA scale, when Home Assistant has an outdoor AQI sensor (AirNow, WAQI, IQAir AirVisual, Google Air Quality and similar).
- Sidebar: an orange **Heat Advisory** (or **Excessive Heat**) flag appears while one is in effect, read from a weather alerts sensor such as NWS Alerts. The badge and flag stay hidden when Home Assistant has no sensor for them.
